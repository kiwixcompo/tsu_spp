UPDATED: Non-Teaching Staff Selection Logic
================================================================================

CHANGE SUMMARY:
===============
Non-teaching staff can now select EITHER:
  - A Unit/Office/Directorate, OR
  - A Faculty + Department

This reflects that some non-teaching staff work in units (ICT, Bursary, etc.)
while others work in academic departments (lab techs, dept secretaries, etc.)

================================================================================
SELECTION OPTIONS
================================================================================

TEACHING STAFF:
---------------
✅ Faculty: REQUIRED
✅ Department: REQUIRED
❌ Unit: Not shown

NON-TEACHING STAFF (Option 1 - Unit):
--------------------------------------
✅ Unit: Select from 51 units/offices
❌ Faculty: Not required
❌ Department: Not required

Example: ICT Officer, Security Staff, Librarian, etc.

NON-TEACHING STAFF (Option 2 - Department):
--------------------------------------------
❌ Unit: Not required
✅ Faculty: Select from faculties
✅ Department: Select from departments

Example: Lab Technician, Department Secretary, etc.

================================================================================
VALIDATION RULES
================================================================================

TEACHING STAFF:
- Must select Faculty AND Department
- Form won't submit without both

NON-TEACHING STAFF:
- Must select EITHER Unit OR (Faculty + Department)
- Cannot submit with nothing selected
- Cannot submit with Faculty but no Department
- If Unit selected, Faculty/Department auto-clear
- If Faculty selected, Unit auto-clears

================================================================================
USER INTERFACE
================================================================================

When "Non-Teaching Staff" is selected, user sees:

┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Unit/Office/Directorate (Optional)      │
│ [Dropdown with 51 units]                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

              OR (badge)

┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Faculty (Optional)  │ Department (Opt)  │
│ [Faculty dropdown]  │ [Dept dropdown]   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

Auto-clear behavior:
- Select Unit → Faculty/Dept clear
- Select Faculty → Unit clears
